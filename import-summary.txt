ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => volley/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => volley/src/main/assets
* libs/okhttp-2.1.0.jar => volley/libs/okhttp-2.1.0.jar
* libs/okhttp-urlconnection-2.1.0.jar => volley/libs/okhttp-urlconnection-2.1.0.jar
* libs/okio-1.1.0 .jar => volley/libs/okio-1.1.0 .jar
* lint.xml => volley/lint.xml
* res/ => volley/src/main/res
* src/ => volley/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
